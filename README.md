# GrocerEZ

## Description

We created the application, GrocerEZ, to give home cooks a seamless way to shop for ingredients from a recipe of their choosing at the grocery store.

Using the app, home cooks can search for recipes based off of their food and taste preferences, as well as dietary restrictions. Once they choose a recipe that they like, they can add the ingredients to an EZ shopping list. The application will generate a shopping list of the ingredients. And while they are shopping, they can easily mark off items as they add them to their cart at the grocery store. 

Because the weather temperatures often dictate our food choices and cravings, we included a weather widget in our application. This way, users can see in real-time what the weather is and use this information to help them decided what kind of recipes they want to search for.

## Technologies

The APIs that we used for our application are Spoonacular and OpenWeather. We used Spoonacular to retrieve recipe and ingredient data for our app. We used OpenWeather to retreive weather data for our app.
